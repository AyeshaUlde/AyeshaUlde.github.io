#### [**Performance and Cost Assessment of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials**](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/CH5650-Term-Project) 

Recreated the results of Spectral Neighbour Analysis Potential (SNAP) for Mo, Si, Ni, and Cu in [Performance and Cost Assessment of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b08723) by Y. Zuo et al. 

#### [**Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection**](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/BOCD)

Python implementation of [Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, Adams, R. P., & MacKay, D. J. C. (2007)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3742.pdf) 

#### [**Generation of 2-D digital microstructures**](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/MM3110-CMEL/tree/main/Digital%20microstructures%20%26%20Data%20Analytics/Part1)

An interactive [MATLAB script](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/MM3110-CMEL/blob/main/Digital%20microstructures%20%26%20Data%20Analytics/Part1/pt1q1.m) which generates the evolution of a 2-D digital microstructure based on the input provided by the user
