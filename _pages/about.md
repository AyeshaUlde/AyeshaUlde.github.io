Hello there! :wave:

I am a fifth-year Interdisciplinary Dual Degree (B.Tech. in [Metallurgical & Materials Engineering](http://mme.iitm.ac.in/) & M.Tech. in Computational Engineering) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I am interested in Computational Materials Science, particularly Machine Learning applications at the atomic scale. 

My broad research interests are:
* Materials Informatics 
* Atomistic Modeling 
* Solid-state Physics
* High-Performance Computing

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books, baking, and cycling through the scenic IIT Madras campus with my friends. I also love exploring museums and trying new food.

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. --->

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. --->

<!--- #Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
